Exercise 1: Messaging System Description

1. Dependent Microservices:
The BookingService needs to notify the RoomService whenever a room is booked.
The communication is done asynchronously using KubeMQ on a channel named `room_update_channel`.

2. Database Description:
- BookingService uses booking_LBS database to store bookings.
- RoomService uses room_LBS to manage room availability.

3. Messaging Code (BookingService):
- Messaging.java (publishes to KubeMQ)
- BookingResource.java (calls sendMessage after booking)

4. Messaging Code (RoomService):
- RoomUpdateListener.java (subscribes to KubeMQ)
- AppContextListener.java (auto-starts RoomUpdateListener on deploy)
